1. Create possibility for companies to add their radius of delivery
2. package for point 1: https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python
3. SQL Query to get restaurants withing given distance:
SELECT r.delivery_distance FROM restaurant as r WHERE r.restaurant_id IN 
(SELECT ra.restaurant_id FROM restaurant_address as ra WHERE ra.address_id IN 
(SELECT a.address_id FROM address a WHERE a.address_name='{location}' AND r.voivodeship = a.voivodeship))

App is now able to get possible restaurants for given location, but only if this location is in database,
Now i have to add that if new address is created check if is valid and then insert it into database and get result for him

For new addresses restaurants are searched correctly, Now to lessen the usage of GOOGLE MAPS API, I have to create:
1. New_address record in database
2. Connect New_address with restaurants in reach, using <restaurant_address> table

*******DONE**********

After that create similar tool to append restaurants via completing form, Might try email verification or reCaptcha
