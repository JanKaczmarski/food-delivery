1. Create possibility for companies to add their radius of delivery
2. package for point 1: https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python
3. SQL Query to get restaurants withing given distance:
SELECT r.delivery_distance FROM restaurant as r WHERE r.restaurant_id IN 
(SELECT ra.restaurant_id FROM restaurant_address as ra WHERE ra.address_id IN 
(SELECT a.address_id FROM address a WHERE a.address_name='{location}' AND r.voivodeship = a.voivodeship))
AND delivery_distance < {delivery_declared_distance};

App is now able to get possible restaurants for given location, but only if this location is in database,
Now i have to add that if new address is created check if is valid and then insert it into database and get result for him

For new addresses restaurants are searched correctly, Now to lessen the usage of GOOGLE MAPS API, I have to create:
1. New_address record in database
2. Connect New_address with restaurants in reach, using <restaurant_address> table

*******DONE**********

After that create similar tool to append restaurants via completing form, Might try email verification or reCaptcha

I came back to the project.

TODO:
1. check if the soon to be partner gave valid data - started doing this in storing_ideas.py
2. add the restaurant to the database
3. Allow the user to update photos of his dishes and restaurant, with limit

Later:
Insert a lot of restaurants for Bia≈Çystok and then try to display them for user that just entered his location.

Finished rebuilding the flask app, changed postgres to sqlite and everything is working, now I have to create the partner website in which it will be easier to insert new restaurants
to the database, I was thinking about using pickAPI from google, simply a map with the option to pick the address. It will ensure that data inside the database is always from the same
source ie. googlemaps

If new partner filled his form, transform the given data to fit into googlemaps and database standard
